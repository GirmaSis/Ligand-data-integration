### Ligand binding data synthesis: Integrating physicochemical and affinity metrics

It focuses on merging and analyzing datasets to extract meaningful insights, specifically related to ligand efficiency and binding affinity. 
The project utilizes data from two primary sources:

- small library_znd.csv containing ligands with their respective binding affinity values.
- 109_p10_filtered_datawarrior.xlsx generated from the Data Warrior tool, providing detailed physicochemical parameters.

***Goal:*** The goal is to integrate these datasets to create a unified view that combines binding affinity data with physicochemical properties. This integration is pivotal for further analysis in drug discovery and molecular docking studies.

**Steps followed:**
***Data Extraction and Cleaning:*** 
Implementing Python and pandas to extract specific 'ZINC' codes from ligand names and cleaning the datasets for precise analysis.

***Data Alignment and Verification:*** 
Aligning the 'ZINC' codes from the CSV file with 'Molecule Names' in the Excel file. This step ensures that the datasets correspond accurately to each other for valid comparisons.

***Dataframe Merging:***
Utilizing pandas to merge dataframes based on common identifiers, ensuring that each 'Molecule Name' has a unique and corresponding ligand and binding affinity data.

***Data Integrity Checks:***
Conducting thorough checks to confirm the correctness of the merged data, ensuring accurate alignment of 'Molecule Names' with the extracted 'ZINC' codes.

***Resultant Data Analysis:*** 
The merged dataset facilitates comprehensive analysis, enabling insights into the relationship between molecular structures and their binding affinities, a key aspect in the evaluation of potential drug candidates.
